# Hi there, I´m Antonio 👋

In this repository you can find the different projects that I have carried out both in my student stage and in my work stage as a researcher.

## Work & studies
💼 I´m Telecommunication Engineer 📡 and I´m currently working as researcher in different projects related to the using of Deep Learning in the forensic study of work of arts 🖼️. <br /> 
Besides, I´m developing my stage as PHD student at the University of Seville 🔬. 
My final degree project and my final master's project (both qualified with honors) can be consulted online. My final degree project on "Deconvolution of color planes in histological images" is accessible at https://idus.us.es/handle/11441/104412. Likewise, my master's thesis on "The application of Deep Learning to segment crossing points in X-rays of old canvases" is accessible at https://idus.us.es/handle/11441/141052. I hope in the future to be able to make the code of both works public. The first is written in MATLAB and the second in Python, using TensorFlow for neural networks.

## 42
🌱 Also, I’m currently learning in 42 Málaga Fundación Telefónica (antdelga user). This amazing formative project allows us to learn about different programming languages, video-games, virtualization, AI, etc. Also, the P2P methodlogy and the cooperative spirit in the Campus is amazing!! You can see more about this project here: 🔗 https://www.42malaga.com <br />
In my profile you will see all my work in 42 projects as I progress.
